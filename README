Mongo-docker is a docker-based framework for testing complicated setups

Here is a quick start guide:
1. Follow the steps in the INSTALL file to set up the OS and packages
2. Adjust the mongodb version and the mongodb package name in the Dockerfile. E.g. for 2.6.5 it would be
    mongo_version 2.6.5
    mongo_pkg mongodb-org
3. Build a new docker image named mongodb_1:
    docker build -t test/mongodb_2.6.5 -f Dockerfile-org .
4. Create a python script with the test scanarion
4.1 Import the mdocker module and the MDocker class, as well as some auxiliary functions
    import mdocker
    from mdocker import wait_to_become_primary, MDocker
4.2 You will likely want to import pymongo and MongoClient as well
    import pymongo
    from pymongo import MongoClient
4.3 Create an instance of MDocker class that will do the docker management
    docker = MDocker()
4.4 Create a deployment scenario as an ordered dictionary { hosname : (image_name, exec_string, port) }
    - Port should be in sync with the exec_string, e.g.:
    deploy = collections.OrderedDict()
    default_image = "alex/mongodb_1"
    deploy["mongo_D1"] = (default_image, "mongod --smallfiles --replSet xxx --port 27017", 27017)
4.5 Call the MDocker.deploy method to deploy the environemnt
    docker.deploy(deploy)
4.6 Upon success (return code 1), the enviornment should be running and accessible using the specified hostnames. Use regular pymongo constructions to initialize it and perform tests
    - the MDocker class has a block(hostname) and an unblock(hostname) methods to drop all in/out packets for the specified host (simulating a TCP black hole)
4.7 Call the MDocker.cleanup method to clean up the enviornment and remove the containers
    docker.cleanup()
5. If your test ezited without cleanup, use this command to stop and remove all existing containers:
    docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

You can also see the tester_S16237.py test as a reference

Good luck, and may the Force be with you!
